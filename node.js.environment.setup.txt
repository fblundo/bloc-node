1) What is npm and what does it do?

NPM stands for Node Package Management. It is a command line tool
to install Node packages and build our application.

2) What kind of information does package.json hold?

It is a json file, that communicates to npm how the application is structured.
More in particular:
- it lists the node packages your project depends on
- it specifies versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules
- it makes the build reproducible, and therefore easier to share with other developers

3) Google another Node package. Using the demo directory run npm install <theNameOfThePackage> --save.
Check the contents of your package.json file to make sure that the dependencies list the name of the Node package.

I have added a new node package, called Underscore. You can see it in the dependencies section of th
json code source reported below.

{
  "name": "demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
        "underscore": "^1.9.1" // added new node package "Underscore"
  }
}
