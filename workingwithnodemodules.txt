Questions
1) How do you import a module?

A module can be imported in different ways.
It can be imported using within another file ('require'), or it can be installed as a package within the package.json dependencies' section
and again, required within the file where we want to use it using the 'require' method.

2) What JavaScript statement do you use to export a module?

module.exports is the statement to use.

3) Are there other ways to export a module?

we could have replaced 'exports' with 'module.exports' and achieved the same result.
They both refer to the same Javascript object.

module.exports = {
sayHelloInEnglish: function() {
return "HELLO";
},

is the same as

exports.sayHelloInEnglish = function() {
return "HELLO";
};

4) What are ES6 modules and how do they differ from the module we created in this checkpoint?

ES6 modules are based on the same idea as other module formats: allow us to compose bigger
programs out of smaller pieces. The modules used in Node.js follow a module specification
known as the CommonJS specification.
Exports of a CommonJS module are defined dynamically while being evaluated, and
imported using 'require'.
ES6 uses a different module system where exports are defined lexically when the code is being
parsed (before it is actually evaluated), and imported using 'import'.
