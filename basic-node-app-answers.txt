1) What is a Node module?

A node module is a set of function that is included in an application.

2) What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

module.exports is the object returned from require().
It is an object that can be reassigned into anything.

3) Why is using exports recommended?

Our module returns module.exports to the caller ultimately, not exports.
All exports does is collect properties and attach them to module.exports
It is better to use exports rather than module.experts because, if something
is then attached to module.experts' object, it will overrid what
has been already added using 'exports'.

Using exports is recommended because in most instances
we are not trying to reassign module.exports.
